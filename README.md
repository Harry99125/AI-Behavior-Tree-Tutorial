\# Teaching Game AI with Behavior Trees in Unreal Engine 5



This repository contains the complete educational package for a teaching project on \*\*AI decision-making in games\*\*, focusing on \*\*Decision Trees and Behavior Trees\*\* implemented in \*\*Unreal Engine 5\*\*.



The goal of this project is to teach how modern game AI makes decisions using clear, structured, and industry-standard techniques.



---



\## Project Overview



In this project, we demonstrate how an enemy AI can:



\- Patrol an area when idle

\- Detect the player using perception logic

\- Chase and attack the player when detected

\- Return to patrol behavior when the player is no longer visible



All behaviors are implemented using \*\*Behavior Trees\*\*, \*\*Blackboards\*\*, and Unreal Engine’s built-in AI systems.



---



\##  Learning Objectives



This project is designed to help learners:



\- Understand what AI Decision Trees and Behavior Trees are

\- Learn how AI state influences decision-making

\- Use Unreal Engine’s Blackboard system to manage AI state

\- Build a complete, reactive AI behavior system

\- Debug AI behavior using Unreal Engine’s visual tools



No prior experience with Unreal Engine or AI is required.

\##  AI Techniques Used



\- Decision Trees (conceptual foundation)

\- Behavior Trees (core decision-making system)

\- Blackboard-based state management

\- Laser-based perception using Line Trace

\- Unreal Engine Navigation and `Move To` / `AI MoveTo`

\##  How to Run the Project



1\. Install \*\*Unreal Engine 5\*\*

2\. Open the `.uproject` file inside the `UnrealProject` folder

3\. Open the main map

4\. Press \*\*Play\*\*

5\. Observe the enemy AI behavior:

   - Patrol → Detect Player → Chase / Attack → Return to Patrol



---



\##  Debugging the AI



\- Open `BT\\\_Enemy` in Unreal Engine

\- Use the \*\*Behavior Tree Debugger\*\*

\- Observe active nodes and Blackboard values in real time



This is strongly recommended for understanding how decisions are made.

\##  Documentation



\- \*\*Tutorial Documentation\*\*: Step-by-step guide explaining concepts and implementation

\- \*\*Pedagogical Report\*\*: Teaching philosophy, concept deep dive, implementation analysis, and assessment



Both documents are located in the `Docs/` folder.
